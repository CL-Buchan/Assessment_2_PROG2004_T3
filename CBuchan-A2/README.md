My project for Assignment 2 T3 PROG2004 2025. 
This is a Java project which demonstrates the functions of a theme park visitor management system which has functions that perform tasks but are not limited to addition, subtraction, clearing data, importing and exporting data, as well as printing from an array. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the complied output folder by default.
